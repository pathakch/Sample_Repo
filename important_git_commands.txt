1. git diff : compare working tree from staging area.--if working directory and staging area are same it won't return anything
2. git diff --staged : compare staging area to last commit.
3. git checkout -f : match working directory to the last commit 
  (if someone changes something and save but we want to be in the last commit state)
4. git rm <filename> : delete file from staging area, 
   means if we did git commit and then we realize we need to remove this file from thn we use this command.
5. git rm --cached : does the same thing in 4 but do not delete the file , it just remove from staging area.
6. git status -s : provide some more visibility about git status-- do practice and understand this command.
7. touch .gitignore : creates gitignore file :which will be helpful if you do not want some files to be tracked then we can put those 
   files/*.extension_name inside the gitignore , then git will not track those files anymore.
8.
